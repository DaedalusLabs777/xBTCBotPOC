## AI Code Redaction Notice
As a commitment to maintaining the highest standards of security and proprietary technology protection, we have redacted specific portions of the AI code in the xBTCBot AI project. This decision is crucial for safeguarding our confidential AI development strategies and preserving the uniqueness of our solution in the marketplace.

## Exclusion of Supporting Software
It is important to note that we have intentionally excluded certain supporting software components, specifically the Bitcoin Node Server API and the Authentication Server API. This decision aligns with our focus on core functionalities and our commitment to security and scalability.
